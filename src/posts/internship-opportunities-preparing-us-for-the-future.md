Internship and Apprenticeship is a program that provides a multitude of benefits for the students at SailFuture Academy. This is a program that the upperclassmen and seniors take part in multiple times a week. The upperclassmen are interns, meaning they only work on Thursdays and Fridays every week whereas the seniors are Apprentices working on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every week. 

During their respective work days the interns and apprentices will work from 9:30am - 4:00pm. An internship will last for one term which is 7 weeks while an apprentice will stay at the same place for the entire year either making their business or working in their desired field. 

After an intern has spent 7 weeks at one location they will start working at a new one next term. These locations are picked based on the future jobs that the interns are considering or already desire to work in. Some of the locations that the interns are working are the Museum of Fine Arts and Tampa Bay Watch in downtown St. Petersburg.

One of the benefits of this program is that it provides students with real world experiences in the work fields that they are considering. This experience can help the students who have already made up their minds about their future to learn about the desired field through actual work and experiences rather than online research. If a student is still considering multiple options this program will allow them to gain experiences in those different options which will make the final decision easier in the future. 

Another benefit of this program is the fact that the students are paid for the work that they do. The most you can make is $300 but this number can be decreased by multiple factors. Everyday that they work their bosses will give them a score based on effort, time management, and maturity to which is averaged out to make their professionalism score. This score along with their grades and attendance is what determines how much they get paid. 

So not only do the upperclassmen get to gain work experience during school hours they also get paid to do it. These are only some of the benefits that partaking in the Impact Social Ventures program provides.
