La’Mya is a senior at SailFuture Academy currently interning at the Frank Pierce recreation center. As she was researching places to Intern, La’Mya thought about her interests and what would be challenging to try. 

She first considered options like working in  a Nursing home dealing with the daily life of geriatrics. Another  consideration was interning in the  to Mental Health field. She chose to intern at The Frank H. Pierce  recreation center. This recreation center offers activities  like basketball, open gym and a teen room for the youth to interact.

Working at this recreation center allows her to mentor, listen and help problem solve and resolve  conflict by teaching better ways to channel frustration. Working at this Rec center will not only  allow her to build relationships, but create unity among their youth and grow as a leader.   La’Mya will have to learn to work with time management, conflict, disgruntled students and personalities along with various age  groups. She will also be prepared to handle any emergencies that may arise. 

Though one of her passions is inspiring and mentoring youth, the primary decision for choosing this internship was based on the money this job would allow her to make in order to achieve other dreams.  After highschool, she hopes to attend college to receive an EMT Certification and work in an ambulance. The skills she will gain working at the Frank H. Pierce Center will help her gain the skills needed to follow her dream pathway.
