Minx. She works as a private yoga instructor. She started this business 3 years ago, rotating between 3 studios in St. Pete or customers can request special locations like beaches, apartment complexes, and international yoga retreats. She started Yogi Minx because she wanted to motivate the people around her to take part in health and wellness as well as do her part as a positive energy in this universe.

Ms. Cece has made a couple of mistakes when running her business. One of these mistakes was charging people less than what she deserved. She’s also seen some of her mistakes as learning opportunities. Over time she  decided that it’s not her prices that needed to change,  she just had to stop serving clients that did not appreciate the value of her services.  She set new standards that her clients would have to meet before she would take them on. Her new standards were people who care about health and wellness as much as she does and can afford the prices that she’s charging. She wants her clients to show their determination towards health and wellness and are interested in maintaining a healthy business relationship with her.

Ms. Cece also has some regrets about her business. She regrets limiting the amount of clients she could have due to taking another job because this stopped her from traveling and increasing her network of clients which would in turn increase the amount of revenue her business was getting. Her business doesn’t have any major competitors that are on her level but she does have some competitors that are subpar in comparison so her revenue isn’t at risk of dropping due to her clients getting taken but it’s still not as high as it could’ve been if she was able to travel and expand her client network.

When I asked Ms. Cece what her definition of success was she gave me three definitions. Her  first definition of success was waking up each morning and not needing to go to work but still wanting to. Her second definition of success was being naturally happy and surrounded by  individuals that have like minded lifestyles and goals like hers that include health and wellness. Her third definition of success was being able to have financial freedom like being able to fly to Paris for pastries just because she wanted to and had the funds to do so.
