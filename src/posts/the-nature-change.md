The climate has changed drastically throughout the United States, even in the past few months. Our local weather in Florida is known for its tropical wet and dry, humid subtropics. It is known for its tornados, hurricanes and fierce lightning. 

Though Florida is called the Sunshine state, it has been anything but sunny. According to the National Weather Center, St. Petersburg estimated about 1.84 inches of rain with an average of 52 degrees daily. An Average month in January living in Florida ranges from 76 for the highs and low of 54. Though the past weeks have proven it can change quickly. 

The weather has shown quite a variation of rain, hurricanes, rising and falling temperatures. While Florida is still carrying a mild Winter, The rest of the Country is dealing with a Cold Blast. According to CBS, this is coming from Canada. The Cold has now impacted the Midwest, Great plains and the Northeast. This cold front will most likely set records.

Though still cold, The south will see warmer temperatures such as Alabama and the southern states. These current conditions are the results of  drastic changes that have impacted our local and National environment because of the following climate changes. Burning Fossil Fuels, cutting down trees and farming livestock. 

By continually doing these things, it is influencing the earthâ€™s temperature.  Some large impacts to our climate are the rising sea levels. This can cause catastrophic results which includes flooding. Other effects to our climate change is loss of sea ice, melting glaciers and ice sheets leading to more intense heat waves. 

The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change believes that Global temperatures will continue to rise because of human work in the environment.  This is a recipe for more Natural Disasters such as Tornadoes, extreme rainfall and Hurricanes. 

Some ways we can help our climate are what we eat and wear, reduce driving by using other means of transportation and not polluting our air with toxins.
