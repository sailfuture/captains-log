The current SailFuture Academy policy is that students are each responsible for their own cell phones. While other schools confiscate phones at the beginning of school, SailFuture instead leaves the responsibility with students and encourages them to keep their phones pocketed for the day. Students are allowed to use electronics during lunch & breaks, but the school has a strict no-tolerance rule about phone use in the classroom.
 
Mr. Thompson, the head of school, explains that the school operates on a 3-strike rule. On the first strike, the teacher gently reminds the student to put their phone away and that they shouldn’t have it out. Upon a teacher seeing the student take it out a second time, the teacher will notify them that their phone will be confiscated if it happens again. If this goes to a third time, the teacher will respond by following through with that, sometimes till the end of the day. 

Teachers and staff members have a similar responsibility, honoring the idea that they shouldn’t use their cellphones during a class period. For example, a teacher wouldn’t be taking personal phone calls during class, same as a student wouldn’t be taking any during class time. Emergencies do happen, and there is latitude for that. However, the main goal of faculty here at SailFuture is to equip students with the best experience that they could possibly have, and that can be difficult with electronics to distract. 

As far as cooperation with this rule, it greatly varies from student to student. There are some students that have exhibited a remarkable amount of professionalism & maturity, and they’ve never had a problem with staying off of their devices during class time. On the other hand, there are other students that have struggled more with being  responsible for their phones. 

Fundamentally, it’s a skill, it’s a discipline, & it’s a practice. Everybody, adults included, need to be in the habit of making choice decisions as to when & when not to use technology; in this case, cell phones. That being said, the purpose of the rule is to let students regulate themselves with electronics & show that it’s something that they can responsibly manage. Otherwise, it’s something that is managed for them, and that’s when cell phones end up getting put in the safe. 

SailFuture, compared to other schools, particularly other private schools, gives more responsibility to the students so that they can manage it in a professional way. The students probably want to have more freedom to be able to use their cell phones whenever they feel like it, but this wouldn’t be particularly helpful in holding an expectation & creating a professional space that needs to be maintained. 

If the goal of SailFuture is to help students to be ready for the real world & for the professional world, then a policy like this, especially a consistently enforced one, is helpful in developing an awareness of when to use a cell phone & when not to use a cell phone.

Consistency is key, and consistency of the expectation is important in making sure that this behavior is a choice. Students don’t have to get their phone taken, they just need to show that they’re responsible enough to manage themselves with it. In that sense, it’s really more of a choice than a rule.
