Diversity is something that exists among individuals, acknowledging variations in characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, abilities, and more. It goes beyond visible traits to include diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. 

Everyone is diverse in their own unique ways. We all have our own special qualities or characteristics. A big group of people who are diverse and have been in the news lately is the lgbtqxyz community. Another group featured in the media recently are immigrants from Mexico trying to illegally get into the United States of America. 

Did you know that 75% of Americans are white, 13% are black or African American, 19% are Hispanic or Latino, and 6% are Asian or Chinese according to the 2022 US Census? Did you know that Liberia is the most racially diverse country in the world? 

According to Wisevoter, one person who played a huge role in diversity and inclusion is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. played a big role in diversity, inclusion, and equality and fought for equal rights for blacks and African Americans. 

He was very big on the idea that everybody should be treated equally regardless of the color of their skin, their gender, their ethnicity, or their sexual identity. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s efforts have impacted and created diversity in today's workplace by helping to create a legal framework that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and sexual orientation. He was also the main leader of the American civil rights movement. He organized a number of peaceful protests. 

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote a speech called "I Have a Dream” on August 28th, 1963. In that speech, he said, “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”

There is no doubt that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has helped positively change the world when we needed it most. Throughout his life, MLK faced hardships; he pushed through obstacles and persevered by faith.

MLK was arrested a whopping 29 times, but that didn't stop him or his goal to change the world, end racism, and stop segregation in the African American community. Did you know that MLK’s house was bombed? According to Stanford University, it happened on January 30, 1956, At 9:15 p.m., while King was speaking before two thousand congregants at a mass meeting at First Baptist Church. 

This shows that even when times were hard, he persevered and advocated for non-violence, diversity, inclusion, and equality, even when it was against his family. To this day, MLK is known for his role in making America diverse, inclusive, and equal.
