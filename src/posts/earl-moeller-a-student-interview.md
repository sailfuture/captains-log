Earl Moeller was born August 11, 2006 in St. Petersburg FL. He was the only one of his siblings that his mom didn't give birth in the house. He chose to go to SailFuture Academy because his previous education choice was not working out. 

His major plans for the future aren’t clear at the moment, but might include nursing or writing books/news articles. 

Earl had a great start to the school. He was a little stressed, though he loved being able to influence others. He said, “it was nice to make a beneficial difference at the school.” This school was a new experience for him. He said it was like a “mandatory summer camp, yes he has to be here but he also wanted to at the same time.” 

Earl liked making new friends. Not only the people in his crew, but other kids around the school as well. In term three so far he has noticed a significant increase in the assignments in the first few weeks of class. Unfortunately, he has been a lot less motivated this term as opposed to all the last, however, he is starting to get back into the rhythm of things. 

Earl reported that the staff has been showing a great level of kindness to him, and even over the past ten weeks, he’s already seen how much they have been caring about the student body. 

He currently doesn't have any backup plans for the future, but he is willing to learn several trades while he's young for a safety net in case his future plans don't work out.
