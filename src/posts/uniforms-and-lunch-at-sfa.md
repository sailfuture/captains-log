School uniforms and school lunch at SailFuture Academy have been a topic of debate for a long time. Some people argue that uniforms promote a sense of unity and equality for students. Others believe kids shouldn’t have to wear uniforms. 

I really don’t like to wear uniforms because I feel like I am being punished for my appearance, but at the same time school uniforms are good because some kids like to wear clothes that are not for school.  A lot of kids at SFA don’t like the school uniform they wish for better. One student said they wish that the sweaters had pockets. It is important to consider the pros and cons of school uniforms and how they impact students' experiences.

Moving on to  SFA school lunches, we all know that a healthy and nutritious meal is good for students. Unfortunately, some schools struggle to give quality lunches due to limited resources. My school lunches are not that bad but I wouldn't say that the lunch is great.  Most of the students would say that they like the school lunches. 

Based on the feedback that I got from other students, some say that they like the lunches and the others say that they don’t like the lunches so it's really a 50/50 that students like and dislike the lunches. My opinion about the lunches is that some days the school provides us with some good food and some days it’s not that great. 

Some kids in general don’t like school lunches because they feel like they are not getting 5 stars meals or they don’t think school lunches are cool. My solution to kids who don't like school lunches should pack and bring their own lunches to school and that would stop kids from complaining that they don’t like the lunches.
