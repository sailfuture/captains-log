What's going on with our economy? Is it really as bad as I've heard? Is our  economy going downhill? You might be asking yourself these questions, let’s give you insight on what's really going on in our economy and what could happen with it in the future.

In the last month of 2023, the U.S. Labor market created more than 200,000 jobs and over 2.7 million total in the year of 2023. How does this affect the economy? According toinvestopedia.com “Creating jobs helps the economy by GDP. When an individual is employed, they are paid by their employer. This results in them having money to spend on food, clothing, entertainment, and in a variety of other areas. The more an individual spends, the more that demand increases. When demand for a product or service increases, companies increase their output to meet the increased demand. Companies do this by investing more and hiring more workers. More workers start the cycle over, with there being even more money spent in the economy, increasing demand further.”

Our economy is not doing as bad as you may think; the process decreases inflation and raises job awareness. You may still be wondering about inflation. Luckily, when  jobs have been created inflation decreases.  

The reason inflation decreases is because the more people buy products or services from these newly created businesses, the more supply there is for the product/service. The increased supply will level out the new demand, leveling potential inflation.
