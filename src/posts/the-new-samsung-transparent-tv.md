Have you ever seen those transparent screens in Star Wars and said, “I want one” but you never could because they didn't exist? Well, now they do at the recent CES 2024 Samsung unveiled the new micro LED transparent tv.  The screen is pretty thin and it is not a projection, the screen is in transparent material. It also runs at a good quality too at micro LED 8k with no bezel, so it blends right into the environment it is in. The Samsung transparent tv is one of the first legitimate fully see-through tv’s.

As of now, it is only a prototype that Samsung is working on, which means they are not for sale. There are other transparent tv’s you can buy, but so far this transparent tv has far surpassed the other tv’s. Most other options  are either blurry, shadowed, just barely transparent or really think in size. The Samsung Transparent TV also has some good speakers to play any audio it puts out. The tv is 76 inches wide and 55 inches tall. It also has a Higher brightness than OLED screens because of the micro LED display. It is also not affected by ambient lighting as much as OLED screens are.

This TV has been in research and development for over six years. Which means that it will probably have a lot of potential and if you have seen Samsung's other traditional tv’s you would know that they look crystal clear. I don’t think we should expect this tv anytime soon I think we should expect this maybe late 2026 maybe 2025 but I think that might be a stretch. I could just imagine a world with people watching tv on a transparent screen that would be so cool.
