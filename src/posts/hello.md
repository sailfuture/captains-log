Dear Students,

<br>

As the head of SailFuture Academy, it's my pleasure to introduce the newest edition of our 'Captain's Log'. This publication is a celebration of the diverse and dynamic community that we have built together.

<br>

 In this second edition of the "SailFuture Captain's Log," our students delve into a diverse array of topics, encompassing campus happenings, insightful interviews, updates on internships, local news, and more. The 'Captain's Log' is more than just a newsletter; it's a reflection of our collective thoughts, ideas, and achievements. 

<br>

Happy reading!

<br>

Hunter Thompson
